- **Tools & Technologies:** Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts, Dashboards), Power Query

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit’s grocery sales data to identify key drivers of revenue, customer preferences, and outlet performance. The dashboard provides a 360° view of sales, items, outlet size, and consumer behavior, enabling management to make data-driven decisions on operations, marketing, and inventory.

## Problem Statement
Blinkit operates across multiple outlets with different sizes, locations, and product categories. Management faced challenegs in :

- Identifying which outlets and item types contribute the most to revenue.
- Understanding sales performance trends over years
- Comparing outlet size/location porfitability
- Tracking customer preferences (fat conten, item type, etc.)
- Optimizing operations to reduce wastage and maximize profitability.

## Solution Aproach
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
    - Handled missing values, standardized categories (Item Type, Outlet Size, Fat Content).
    - Used **Power Query** for transformation and combining data
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Identified Key KPIs: Total Sales, Avg Sales, Items Count, Avg rating
    - Compared outlets by size, type and tier location
    - Analyzed product categories (Fruits, Dairy, Frozen foods etc.)
3. **Dashboard Design**
    - Built an interactive Excel dashboard with:
      - Slicers (Outlet Size, Outlet Location, Item Type)
      - KPI Cards (Total Sales, Avg Sales, Items, Ratings)
      - Trend Analysis (2011-2022 Sales)
      - Category & Outlet performance breakdown
      - Fat Content impact on sales
     
## Key Insights
  - **Total Sales** : $1.20M with Avg Sales per item = $141.
  - **Fat Content** : Regular items drive 65% of sales, indicating customer preference.
  - **Item Categories**: Fruits & Vegetables ($178K) and Snack Foods ($175K) are top-performing categories.
  - **Outlets** : Medium-sized outlets generated the highest sales ($507.9K, 42%).
  - **Location** : Tier 3 outlets outperform others ($472K in sales), suggesting strong demand in suburban areas.
  - **Trend** : Sales peaked in 2018 ($204.5K) but later declined, requiring further strategy review.

## Recommendations
  - **Expand Medium-sized Outlets** in Tier 3 locations, as they contribute the most revenue.
  - **Focus Marketing on Fruits, Vegetables & Snacks** to boost sales further.
  - **Promote Low-Fat Items** to diversify sales since they already contribute 35%.
  - **Investigate Sales Decline (Post-2018)** – review external factors (competition, pricing, demand shifts).
  - **Optimize Outlet Performance** by replicating successful Tier 3 strategies across Tier 1 & 2.
